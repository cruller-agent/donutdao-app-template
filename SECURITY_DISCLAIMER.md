## Security Tools (Free)

**Run these before deploying:**

### 1. Slither (Static Analysis)
```bash
pip install slither-analyzer
slither packages/foundry/contracts/
```

**What it finds:**
- Reentrancy vulnerabilities
- Unprotected functions
- Dangerous delegatecalls
- Integer overflows (pre-0.8.0)

### 2. Mythril (Symbolic Execution)
```bash
pip install mythril
myth analyze contracts/YourContract.sol
```

**What it finds:**
- Integer overflows
- Unprotected self-destruct
- Reentrancy
- Access control issues

### 3. Foundry Fuzz Testing
```solidity
function testFuzz_transfer(address to, uint256 amount) public {
    vm.assume(to != address(0));
    vm.assume(amount <= totalSupply);
    // Test with random inputs
}
```

**What it tests:**
- Edge cases automatically
- Unexpected input combinations
- Invariant violations

### 4. Echidna (Property Testing)
```bash
brew install echidna  # or docker
echidna-test contracts/YourContract.sol
```

**What it tests:**
- Contract invariants
- Property-based tests
- Deep fuzzing

**In your contract:**
```solidity

pragma solidity ^0.8.20;

/**
 * @title YourContract
 * @notice ⚠️ EXPERIMENTAL - AI-GENERATED
 * @dev This contract was autonomously generated by an AI agent

 */
contract YourContract {
    // Your code
}
```

**In your frontend:**
```typescript
// Show warning on first load
const SecurityWarning = () => (
  <div className="bg-yellow-50 border-l-4 border-yellow-400 p-4">
    <div className="flex">

## Remember:

✅ **Be transparent** - Users deserve to know  
✅ **Start small** - Test with low stakes  
✅ **Iterate quickly** - Fix bugs as found  
✅ **Community helps** - Get reviews when possible  
✅ **Know your limits** - Get professional audit for high-risk  

❌ **Don't hide AI origin** - Transparency builds trust  
❌ **Don't skip testing** - Bugs are inevitable  
❌ **Don't deploy high-risk without audit** - Not worth the risk  
❌ **Don't ignore warnings** - Static analysis tools save lives
